\title{Definition of an NMR fit.}
\description{
This class is used to extend an NMRMixture1D object with NMRData1D while
also defining baseline and phase correction terms. There is just one primary
method associated with this class: fit(). fit() takes input data and peak
definitions, applies a nonlinear least squares fit, and generates best-fit
peak parameters, overwriting the initial values. Since the fit process is
destructive, the nmrfit_1d() function used to initialize a fit object has an
option to delay the fit, allowing pre-fit and post-fit objects to be saved
as different variables.

\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{nmrdata}}{An NMRData1D object used to fit the peaks.}

\item{\code{knots}}{A vector of chemical shifts corresponding to the internal knots
of the baseline term (two boundary knots are always included).}

\item{\code{baseline}}{A vectors of complex numeric values representing the baseline.
The actual baseline is generated from a basis spline so these
values are control points that are roughly proportional to the
intensity values of the baseline based on the chemical shift
locations of the knots. The default baseline order and the
number of internal knots can be set using
nmrpotions$baseline = list(order = 3, n.knots = 0),
with the baseline vector length equal to the order + n.knots +
1.}

\item{\code{phase}}{A vector of phase correction terms, corresponding to either 0 or
1st order phase correction. The default phase correction order
can be set using nmroptions$phase = list(order=1). Note
that the 0 order term is always calculated with respect to 0 ppm
and the first order term has units of degrees per ppm.}

\item{\code{bounds}}{A lower and upper bounds on baseline and phase terms. Both lower
and upper bounds are lists containing "baseline", and "phase"
elements. A "peaks" element is also generated dynamically from
the species list when using the bounds() getter function. Unlike
peaks, baseline and phase only have a single lower and upper
bound, representing the overall minimum/maximum baseline/phase
value at any point in the spectrum.}
