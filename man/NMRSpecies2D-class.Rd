\title{Definition of an NMR species.}
\description{
Essentially, this class is used to collect and define volume relations
between multiple resonances as part of a single species.

\section{Slots}{

\describe{
\item{\code{children}}{A list of NMRResonance2D objects.}

\item{\code{connections}}{A data.frame relating the volumes of the resonances.}

\item{\code{connections.leeway}}{A value specifying how tightly enforced the
connection constraints on resonance volumes should
be. E.g. a value of = 0 specifies that the volume
ratios are exact, whereas 0.1 specifies that the
volumes of the resonances may differ by +/- 10
percent from the specified ratios.}
