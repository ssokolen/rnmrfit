\usage{
nmrmixture_1d(species, id = "mixture", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{species}{A list of NMRSpecies1D objects or other objects that can be
converted to NMRSpecies1D objects. See ?nmrresonance_1d and
?nmrspecies_1d for more details about this conversion. If list
elements are named, these names will be use to replace species
ids.}

\item{id}{An optional string specifying mixture name. If left empty, the
mixture name is left as the default "mixture"}

\item{...}{Options passed to nmrspecies_1d if resonances are being converted
from character/numeric vectors. See ?nmrresonance_1d for more
details.}

An NMRMixture1D object.
