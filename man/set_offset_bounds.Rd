\description{
This function provides a convenience method for generating bounds using a
simple set of lower and upper constraints on basic peak parameters such as
position, height, width, fraction.gauss. The term "offset" refers to the
fact that bounds are applied as an offset to current values of the
parameters. These bounds can be expressed in absolute (e.g. -0.1 and +0.1
ppm) or relative (e.g. -1 percent and +1 percent) terms. If used on an
anything more complicated than an NMRResonance1D, the function propogates
the bounds to component resonances.
}
\details{
In practice, offset bounds are primarily useful for preventing peak
positions from drifting too much from initial guesses and for fine-tuning a
fit once an initial optimization is performed. It is not recommended to use
strict offset bounds based on rough initial parameter guesses.
