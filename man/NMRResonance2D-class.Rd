\title{Definition of an NMR resonance.}
\description{
Essentially, this class is used to define coupling relationships to group
individual peaks into resonances. A resonance is a series of peaks that are
constrained by a set of relations between their position, width, and,
fraction.gauss parameters as well as overall areas. A 2D resonance is simply
a collection of 1D resonances in the direct and indirect dimension with
separate set of coupling constraints.
