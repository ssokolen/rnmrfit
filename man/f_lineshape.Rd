\usage{
f_lineshape(object, ...)

\S4method{f_lineshape}{NMRScaffold2D}(
  object,
  sf = c(nmroptions$direct$sf, nmroptions$indirect$sf),
  sum.peaks = TRUE,
  include.id = FALSE,
  components = "rr/ii"
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An NMRScaffold1D object.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to inheriting methods.}

\item{sum.peaks}{TRUE to add all individual peaks together and output a
single function, FALSE to output a data frame of functions
that correspond to individual peaks.}

\item{include.id}{TRUE to include id outer column if outputting data frame.}

\item{components}{'r/i' to output both real and imaginary data, 'r' to output
only real and 'i' to output only imaginary.}

\item{direct.sf}{Sweep frequency (in MHz) -- needed to convert peak widths
from Hz to ppm. In most cases, it is recommended to set a
single default value using nmroptions$direct$sf = ..., but
an override can be provided here.}
}
\value{
A function or tbl_df data frame of functions where each function
        outputs spectral intensity data given a vector input of chemical
        shifts. In the latter case, the functions are stored in a list column
        called f.
}
\description{
This is primarily an internal method that outputs a function (or a tbl_df
data frame of functions), where each function outputs spectral intensity
data given a vector input of chemical shifts.
