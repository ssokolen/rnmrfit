\title{Get 1D projection of indirect dimension}
\usage{
indirect(object)

\S4method{indirect}{NMRData2D}(object)

\S4method{indirect}{NMRScaffold2D}(object)

\S4method{indirect}{NMRSpecies2D}(object)

\S4method{indirect}{NMRMixture2D}(object)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An NMRData2D or NMRScaffold2D object.}
}
\description{
Warning: this is currently a convenience method to facilitate internal data
manipulation, so the conversion may drop important data. When applied to a
an NMRScaffold2D object, the direct components are simply dropped, and
when applied to an NMRData2D object, the direct components are summed
together to give a 1D projection. No normalization is performed so non-
uniform sampling may result in distorted results.
